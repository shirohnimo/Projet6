Ansible module in Python

The aim of the project is to create an Ansible module in python language.
I'm planning to create and maybe implement an iptables file created with data in a JSON file

My sheduled steps are :
1) Create an Ansible playbook to push one iptables rule on a server
2) Code a script in python invoking the basic Ansible playbook previously created
3) Update the python script to load the JSON file and apply the Ansible playbook for each data
4) Create the Ansible module invoking the python script

Future updates if enough time left
* python script to manage/update the JSON file
* update the script to apply the new content with the Ansible module
